# Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS + GTS + ADR Starter Boilerplate

Welcome to your new project! This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), enhanced with the power of Tailwind CSS for styling, Google's GTS (Google TypeScript Style) for consistent coding standards, and Architecture Decision Records (ADR) for capturing and sharing decision-making processes.

## Getting Started

First things first, let's get your development server up and running. You can choose your preferred package manager to start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your project live.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Start building out your project by editing `app/page.tsx`. Thanks to the hot reload feature, you'll see your updates in real-time as you edit.

This project is set up with [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize the loading of Inter, a versatile Google Font, enhancing your site's performance and visual appeal.

## Tailwind CSS Integration

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to style your app efficiently. It's configured and ready to go in this boilerplate, enabling you to build beautifully designed interfaces with minimal effort.

## GTS for Linting

We use Google's TypeScript Style (GTS) to ensure our codebase remains clean, readable, and consistent. GTS provides a set of TypeScript style rules and tslint configurations that Google uses, helping us to avoid bike-shedding over syntax and formatting.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

To document our architectural decisions, we use ADRs. These records help us keep track of the reasons behind decision-making processes, providing insights and rationales for future reference. It's a great way to maintain project knowledge and share it with new team members.
